- 👋 Hi, my name is Joni.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading and gaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS and JS based libraries, such as React and Vue.
  I want to start my own software business one day. Until then, I'll try to make new projects consistently and add my projects here.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to do any collabs atm, but you're free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. Thanks.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at joni.putkinen@protonmail.com.
