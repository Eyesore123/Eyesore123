- 👋 Hi, my name is Joni.
- 👀 Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- 🌱 Currently I'm learning React.js and Vue.js.
  I want to start my own software business one day. Until then, I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to do any collabs atm, but you're free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. Thanks.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at joni.a.putkinen@gmail.com.
