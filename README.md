- üëã Hey, what's up? My name is Joni. Welcome and enjoy your stay! Check out my homepage: https://jonis-portfolio.netlify.app/
- My new blog site: https://blog-app-production-16c2.up.railway.app/
- You can also take a look at my previous homepage that I'm still updating every now and then: https://eyesore123.github.io/Joni-s-portfolio/
- üå± Right now I'm still working on my blog app. Before my blog app project I made a quote generator using Python, Angular.js and postgreSQL. And recently I finished a web store that I made using Next.js, React Redux, TypeScript and Firebase.
- All my projects can be easily copied and pasted into your working directory. Or you can just use "git clone". I have instructions in my repos only when set-up requires some kind of installation.
-  I've used course material from different courses in many of my projects in the past, but I've added here only projects that are modified to some degree. I like adding new features to course projects and trying to make them a little better. Now that I have more experience, I don't work on course projects anymore but jump straight into making my own apps from start to finish. Most of my projects are original including: online store, snake game, recipe app, portfolio website, personal blog site, math puzzle game and philosopher quiz. I've made a couple of simple websites for business use. I've also made a website assessment tool and a website contact tool for personal use.
- I'm not a fan of coding but I like tinkering. I've been a fan of games since I was a child and felt great excitement and accomplishment when I was able to make my own games with JavaScript. I want to make games that even I would want to play. Honestly my projects do not look that good but I always want to make the user experience as good as possible.
- I want to start my own software business one day, but now I'm fully focusing on my personal projects. I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here. I have so many great ideas about what I want to do. I have one SaaS product in mind that I would like to try making but I know I need to improve my backend skills for that since it relies heavily on managing large processes on the backend and it would probably take months to build.
- In the future I'd also like to do at least space invaders and tetris games in JavaScript for practice, a project management site with advanced tools and an app for work team coordination and scheduling.
- üëÄ Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- Recently I've been building small games and apps with different programming languages. I'm also tinkering with AI tools and exploring different possibilities of utilizing the power of large language models (ChatGPT and Deepseek).
For some reason I do almost everything with JavaScript, and JavaScript is the only language I'm truly comfortable with at the moment. I'm working on my Python skills and my plan is to make a few games using Python.
- I use PHP for backend but am familiar with Node.js. I prefer PHP over Node.js because Node.js apps can be a pain to set up considering that many shared hosting providers still lack support for Node.js or SSH. I can make stylish websites using Wordpress.
- I'm a sports management professional and have been working in the municipal sector. Coding is mainly a hobby. I've never worked in the tech field.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm ready to work together on some new project! I take part in open source projects on the easier end, so if you need extra hands, hit me up! You're also free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. More projects coming soon. Thanks.
