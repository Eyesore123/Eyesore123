- üëã Hey, what's up? My name is Joni. Welcome and enjoy your stay! Check out my homepage: https://jonis-portfolio.netlify.app/
- Recently I've been working mostly on my new blog site: https://blog-app-production-16c2.up.railway.app/
- You can also take a look at my previous homepage: https://eyesore123.github.io/Joni-s-portfolio/
- üå± Right now I'm still adding features to my blog app. Before my blog app project I made a quote generator using Python, Angular.js and postgreSQL. And recently I finished a web store that I made using Next.js, React Redux, TypeScript and Firebase.
- All my projects can be easily copied and pasted into your working directory. Or you can just use "git clone". I have instructions in my repos only when set-up requires some kind of installation.
-  I've used course material from different courses in many of my projects in the past, but I've added here only projects that are modified to some degree. Now that I have more experience, I don't work on course projects anymore but jump straight into making my own apps from start to finish. Most of my projects are original including: online store, snake game, recipe app, portfolio website, personal blog site, math puzzle game and philosopher quiz. I've made a couple of simple websites for business use. I've also made a website assessment tool and a website contact tool for personal use. Website assessment tool was vibe coded, though.
- I'm not a fan of coding but I like tinkering. I've been a fan of games since I was a child and felt great excitement and accomplishment when I was able to make my own games with JavaScript. I want to make games that even I would want to play. Honestly my projects do not look that good but I always want to make the user experience as good as possible.
- I want to start my own software business one day, but now I'm fully focusing on my personal projects. I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here. I have so many great ideas about what I want to do. I have one SaaS product in mind that I would like to try making but I know I need to improve my backend skills for that since it relies heavily on managing large processes on the backend and it would probably take months to build.
- In the future I'd also like to do at least space invaders and tetris games in JavaScript for practice, a project management site with advanced tools, and perhaps some anime pirate site clone.
- üëÄ Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- I'm tinkering with AI tools and exploring different possibilities. I plan on adding AI features to my blog.
- For some reason I do almost everything with JavaScript and TypeScript. JavaScript is the only language I'm truly comfortable with at the moment.
- I use PHP for backend but am familiar with Node.js. I prefer PHP over Node.js because Node.js apps can be a pain to set up considering that many shared hosting providers still lack support for Node.js or SSH. I can make also stylish websites using Wordpress.
- I'm a sports management professional and have been working in the municipal sector. Coding is mainly a hobby. I've never worked in the tech field.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm ready to work together on some new project! I take part in open source projects on the easier end, so if you need extra hands, hit me up! Currently I'm still unemployed so I can help with sites for free.
You can send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. More projects coming soon. Thanks.
