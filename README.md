- 👋 Hi, my name is Joni. Check out my homepage: https://eyesore123.github.io/Joni-s-portfolio/
- I know I shouldn't say 'homepage' but landing page. From the perspective of website routing it is often the case that the homepage is not the landing page, but when it comes to Finnish - my native language -, people talk about 'homepages'.
- I'm not a fan of coding but I like tinkering. I've been a fan of games since I was a child and felt great excitement and accomplishment when I was able to make my own games with JavaScript. I want to make games that even I would want to play. Honestly my projects do not look that good but I always want to make the user experience as good as possible.
- All my projects can be easily copied and pasted to your working directory. I have instructions in my repos only when set-up requires some kind of installation and not just a code editor with live server or preview functionality.
-  I use course material from different courses in many of my projects, but I add here only projects that are modified to some degree. I like adding new features to course projects and trying to make them a little better. Most of my projects are original including: snake game, recipe app, portfolio website, math puzzle game and philosopher quiz. I've made a couple of simple websites for business use.
- 👀 Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- 🌱 Currently I'm learning React.js, Vue.js and Next.js. I'm trying out C# in case I want to pursue game development. It kinda makes we want to learn C++ for game development. For some reason I do almost everything with JavaScript. But I use PHP for backend.
- I'm also tinkering with AI tools and exploring the new possibilities of large language models (ChatGPT and Deepseek).
  I want to start my own software business one day, but now I'm fully focusing on my personal projects. I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here. I have so many great ideas about what I want to do.
  In the future I'd like to do at least a good-looking portfolio site, space invaders and tetris games, a project management site with advanced tools and an app for work team coordination and scheduling.
- I'm a sports management professional and have been working in the municipal sector. Coding is mainly a hobby.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to do any collabs at the moment, but you're free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. More projects coming soon. Thanks.
