- üëã Hey, what's up? My name is Joni. Welcome and enjoy your stay! Check out my homepage: https://eyesore123.github.io/Joni-s-portfolio/
- I know I shouldn't say 'homepage' but landing page. From the perspective of website routing it is often the case that the homepage is not the landing page, but when it comes to Finnish - my native language -, people talk about 'homepages'.
- I'm not a fan of coding but I like tinkering. I've been a fan of games since I was a child and felt great excitement and accomplishment when I was able to make my own games with JavaScript. I want to make games that even I would want to play. Honestly my projects do not look that good but I always want to make the user experience as good as possible.
-üå± Right now I'm practicing Laravel for web dev and Figma for mock-ups. Recently I finished a web store that I made using Next.js, React Redux, TypeScript and Firebase.
- All my projects can be easily copied and pasted into your working directory. Or you can just use "git clone". I have instructions in my repos only when set-up requires some kind of installation.
-  I use course material from different courses in many of my projects, but I add here only projects that are modified to some degree. I like adding new features to course projects and trying to make them a little better. Most of my projects are original including: online store, snake game, recipe app, portfolio website, math puzzle game and philosopher quiz. I've made a couple of simple websites for business use.
- I want to start my own software business one day, but now I'm fully focusing on my personal projects. I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here. I have so many great ideas about what I want to do.
- In the future I'd like to do at least a good-looking portfolio site with Next.js, space invaders and tetris games in JavaScript, a project management site with advanced tools and an app for work team coordination and scheduling.
- üëÄ Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- Recently I've been building small games and apps with different programming languages. I want to get a taste of different possibilities and languages before committing to a single career path. I'm also tinkering with AI tools and exploring different possibilities of utilizing the power of large language models (ChatGPT and Deepseek).
- I'm trying out C# in case I want to pursue game development, and currently I'm making small desktop apps with C#. I kinda want to learn C++, too. For some reason I do almost everything with JavaScript, and JavaScript is the only language I'm truly comfortable with at the moment. I'm working on my Python skills and my plan is to make a few games using Python.
- I use PHP for backend but am familiar with Node.js. I prefer PHP over Node.js because Node.js apps can still be a pain to set up considering that many shared hosting providers still lack support for Node.js or SSH. I can make stylish websites using Wordpress.
- I'm a sports management professional and have been working in the municipal sector. Coding is mainly a hobby. I've never worked in the tech field.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm ready to work together on some new project! I take part in open source projects on the easier end, so if you need extra hands, hit me up! You're also free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. More projects coming soon. Thanks.
