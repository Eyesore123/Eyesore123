- 👋 Hi, my name is Joni. Check out my homepage: https://eyesore123.github.io/Joni-s-portfolio/
- 👀 Hobbies: coding, reading, gaming, calisthenics, anime/manga.
- 🌱 Currently I'm learning React.js, Vue.js and Next.js. For some reason I do almost everything with JavaScript. But I use PHP for backend.
  I want to start my own software business one day. Until then, I'll try to make new projects consistently and add them here.
- I'm a sports management professional and have been previously working in the municipal sector. Coding is mainly a hobby.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to do any collabs at the moment, but you're free to send me feedback after taking a look at my projects. More projects coming soon. Thanks.
- I use course material from different courses in most of my projects. I like adding new features and trying to make course projects a little better. I have some original projects that I made from scratch including: recipe app, portfolio website and philosopher quiz.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at joni.a.putkinen@gmail.com.
